Temporal reasoning through translation of tock-CSP into Timed Automata for UPPAAL. 

The repository contains:

1- An extended report for the translation work (pdf file).

2- A software for automating the translation technique.

3- Other relevant materials for both trace analysis and performance analysis.

NOTE: Running the translation tool requires Haskell compiler because the application was developed with Haskell.
While generating traces require FDR and UPPAAL. UPPAAL tool is included in the translation tool, but FDR is not included. 
Therefore FDR should be installed for running the supporting tool.

Thanks for your interest in our work.
